      'Reverse crunches effectively target the lower abdominal muscles and improve core strength. Start by lying on your back with your arms at your sides and legs bent at a 90-degree angle. Engage your core as you lift your hips off the ground, curling them toward your chest in a controlled motion, then slowly lower them back down. Avoid using momentum and focus on smooth, deliberate movements for best results.',
      'Leg raises are a simple and effective exercise to strengthen your lower abdominal muscles. Lie flat on your back with your arms at your sides and legs extended straight. Keeping your core engaged, slowly lift your legs until they form a 90-degree angle with your body, then lower them back down without letting them touch the ground. Maintain control throughout the movement to maximize the benefits and avoid straining your lower back.',
      'The high plank is a foundational core-strengthening exercise that also engages your shoulders, arms, and legs. Start in a push-up position with your hands directly under your shoulders and your body forming a straight line from head to heels. Keep your core tight, avoid arching your back or raising your hips, and hold the position for 20–60 seconds, focusing on maintaining proper form. Breathe steadily throughout the hold for maximum stability and endurance.',
      'The side plank is an excellent exercise to strengthen your obliques, core, and stabilizing muscles. Lie on one side with your legs stacked and your elbow directly under your shoulder. Lift your hips off the ground, creating a straight line from your head to your feet. Keep your core tight and hold the position for 20–60 seconds, ensuring your body stays aligned. Repeat on the other side for balanced strength development.',
      'Push-ups are a classic upper-body exercise that targets the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core. Start in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your body in a straight line from head to heels. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your chest is close to the ground, then push back up to the starting position. Maintain a tight core and steady breathing for proper form, and aim for 10–15 repetitions or more based on your fitness level.',

Push through the front heel to return to the starting position and alternate legs.', // 'Step-ups are a great exercise for strengthening the legs and glutes. Start by standing in front of a bench or sturdy platform, with your feet hip-width apart. Step one foot onto the bench, pressing through your heel to lift your body up, and bring your other leg up to stand fully on the bench. Step back down with the same leg you started with, then repeat with the opposite leg. Perform 10–15 reps per leg, focusing on controlled movements. For added difficulty, hold dumbbells in each hand.',
      'Wall squats strengthen legs and improve endurance. Press your back against a wall, slide down until thighs are parallel to the ground, knees at 90 degrees. Hold the position for the desired time, keeping core engaged.', // 'Glute bridges are an effective exercise for targeting the glutes, hamstrings, and core. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Place your arms by your sides with palms facing down. Push through your heels to lift your hips towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top. Keep your back straight and avoid arching it. Lower your hips back down to the ground in a controlled motion. Repeat for 10–15 reps, focusing on engaging your glutes throughout the movement.',
      'Calf raises are a simple but effective exercise for strengthening the calf muscles. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, either on flat ground or with the balls of your feet on an elevated surface like a step. Slowly raise your heels as high as possible, squeezing your calves at the top, then lower your heels back down to the starting position. Perform 15-20 repetitions, keeping your movements controlled. For added difficulty, hold dumbbells in each hand or perform the exercise on one leg at a time.',
